CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

Used to style HTML tags, decide how they show up on the page.

All CSS looks like this:

[ insert element here ] {
    color: red;
    font-size: large;
    font-weight: bold;
}

There are three types of CSS:
    - Inline CSS (within the line)
    - Internal CSS (not within the same line, but within the same document)
    - External CSS (in a separate document, linked in the HTML)
